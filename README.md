VR scooter training game VR scooter game that teaches road rules and how to drive a scooter. It was made by the UF MiDAS 2020 cohort for their Entertainment Technology class in the fall semester of 2020.

## Hardware

## Controls
We designed the controls of the VR scooter to be as close as possible to that of a real scooter. There are three main controls:
- Press the `Trigger` button on the right controller to accelerate the scooter.
- Press the `Trigger` button on the left controller to deccelerate the scooter.
- Turn the handlebars as shown in the hardware diagram to change the heading of your scooter.

## Gameplay
There are two distinct modes in Scoot: the tutorial scene and the training scene.

**Tutorial Scene:** The tutorial scene teaches the user the many types of road interactions that will be present in the main training scene, but at the user's pace. The types of interactions are as follows:
- Slowing to a stop at a stop sign
- Looking both ways at a stop sign before accelerating again
- Slowing to a stop at a traffic signal
- Turning around sharp corners
- Monitoring your scooter's speed to be within the speed limit

**Training Scene:** The training scene is based on UF's hometown of Gainesville, FL, where the MiDAS cohort make their residence. We modeled the environment after a busy intersection near the edge of campus in downtown Gainesville, with special care taken to the size and shape of the real buildings in order to get as close as possible to the real environment within the time allotted to use for the project. A major difference between this scene and the tutorial scene is the presence of traffic; cars will come and go around the player, so they must take heed to not crash into them while driving their scooter.
